    "Concurrency and parallelism are similar terms, but they are not the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency is the ability to run multiple tasks on the CPU at the same time. Tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. In the case of a single CPU, multiple tasks are run with the help of context switching, where the state of a process is stored so that it can be called and executed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism, meanwhile, is the ability to run multiple tasks at the same time across multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though they can increase the speed of your application, concurrency and parallelism should not be used everywhere. The use case depends on whether the task is CPU-bound or IO-bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks that are limited by the CPU are CPU-bound. For example, mathematical computations are CPU-bound since computational power increases as the number of computer processors increases. Parallelism is for CPU-bound tasks. In theory, If a task is divided into n-subtasks, each of these n-tasks can run in parallel to effectively reduce the time to 1/n of the original non-parallel task. Concurrency is preferred for IO-bound tasks, as you can do something else while the IO resources are being fetched.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best example of CPU-bound tasks is in data science. Data Scientists deal with huge chunks of data. For data preprocessing, they can split the data into multiple batches and run them in parallel, effectively decreasing the total time to process. Increasing the number of cores results in faster processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is IO-bound. Because the task has little effect on the CPU since most of the time is spent on reading from and writing to the network. Other common IO-bound tasks include database calls and reading and writing files to disk. Web applications, like Django and Flask, are IO-bound applications."
