https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/69/write-an-excellent-programming-blog,Write an Excellent Programming Blog,69,Do you have a blog? How many articles have you written for it? Do you find it hard to keep writing or hard to get started doing technical writing? We might be able to help you out with that this week.,2016-07-26
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/54/enterprise-software-with-python,Enterprise Software with Python,54,How often have people asked what language / technology you work in and when you answered Python they got a little confused and asked, what can you actually build with Python? What type of apps? The implication being Python is just a notch above Bash scripts. That real things aren't built with Python but rather Java, C#, Objective-C and so on.,2016-04-14
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/61/free-software-free-people,Free software, free people,61,How often do you read some news headline about free speech denied and human rights being suppressed and think that sucks but there is nothing I can do about it from my distant perspective. I guess you could vote slightly differently in the next election and maybe, just maybe, it will have a small impact in 4 years time.,2016-05-30
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/68/crossing-the-streams-with-podcast.-init,Crossing the streams with Podcast.__init__,68,Have you listened to the other major Python podcast hosted by Tobias Macey and Chris Patti? It's called podcast.__init__ and, like this show, they have some excellent stories from the Python ecosystem on there weekly. So recently some listeners from both shows suggested the unimaginable: That we 'cross the streams'...,2016-07-20
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/52/eve-online-mmo-game-powered-by-python,EVE Online: MMO game powered by Python,52,Have you ever played a massively multiplayer online game? My first experience with these types of games with text-based role playing games called MUDs back in the early 90's. Well, things have come a long way since then. Game such as Eve Online have hundreds of thousands of players exploring, trading, and battling within a universe of over 7,000 star systems. Gameplay in Eve Online consists of beautiful 3D space flight within a dynamic universe and many real world players.,2016-03-27
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/60/scaling-python-to-1000s-of-cores-with-ufora,Scaling Python to 1000's of cores with Ufora,60,You've heard me talk previously about scaling Python and Python performance on this show. But on this episode I'm bringing you a very interesting project pushing the upper bound of Python performance for a certain class of applications.,2016-05-24
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/64/inside-the-python-package-index,Inside the Python Package Index,64,What is the most powerful part of the Python ecosystem? Well, the ability to say 'pip install magic_library' has to be right near the top. But do you what powers the Python Package Index and the people behind it? Did you know it does over 300 TB traffic each month these days?,2016-06-24
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/56/data-science-from-scratch,Data Science from Scratch,56,You likely know that Python is one of the fastest growing languages for data science.         This is a discipline that combines the scientific inquiry of hypotheses and tests, the mathematical intuition of probability and statistics, the AI foundations of machine learning, a fluency in big data processing, and the Python language itself. That is a very broad set of skills we need to be good data scientists and yet each one is deep and often hard to understand.,2016-04-27
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/62/san-diego-technology-immersion-group-learns-python,San Diego Technology Immersion Group Learns Python,62,What's it like to learn Python? Yes, some of you may have just picked up the language while others have lived and breathed it for years. Either way, you may have some hindsight bias towards the experience. What was hard? What were your expectations? What delighted you?,2016-06-07
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/59/sagemath-open-source-is-ready-to-compete-in-the-classroom,SageMath - Open source is ready to compete in the classroom,59,What do you do when you are a high caliber mathematician or scientist and you want share your algorithms and code? This sounds like a job for github, but the problem is often this work is done on proprietary platforms such as Magma, Matlab, Mathematica or others.,2016-05-18
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/58/create-better-python-programs-with-concurrency-libraries-and-patterns,Create better Python programs with concurrency, libraries, and patterns,58,What do you focus on once you've learned the core concepts of the Python programming language and ecosystem?,2016-05-10
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/50/web-scraping-at-scale-with-scrapy-and-scrapinghub,Web scraping at scale with Scrapy and ScrapingHub,50,What do you do when you are working with an amazing web application that, for whatever reason, doesn't have an API? One option is to say I wish that site had an API and give up. Or, you could use scrapy, an open source web scraping framework from Pablo Hoffman and &lt;a href='scrapinghub.com'&gt;scrapinghub.com&lt;/a&gt; and create your own API!,2016-03-15
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/66/faster-python-programs-measure-dont-guess,Faster Python Programs: Measure, Don't Guess,66,Python is a wonderful programming language that is often underestimated because it's so clear and simple. Oftentimes people mistake this simplicity for being too simple for real-programs. After all, you didn't even struggle to get your program to link against an incompatible static library or battle a DLL version mismatch in your Python app today did you?,2016-07-07
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/55/how-our-engineering-environments-are-killing-diversity-and-how-we-can-fix-it,How our engineering environments are killing diversity (and how we can fix it),55,In the software field, we pride ourselves on fairness, openness and the fact that our workplaces are largely meritocracies. And compared to other environments, I would say this is certainly true. It's one of the reasons I love being a developer.        And yet, if we look at programming jobs in Silicon Valley, you'll see that over 85% of them are filled by men and less than 15% women.,2016-04-21
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/67/property-based-testing-with-hypothesis,Property-based Testing with Hypothesis,67,Let's talk about your unit testing strategy. How do you select the tests you write or do you even write tests? Typically, when you write a test you have to think of what you are testing and the exact set of inputs and outcomes you're looking for. And there are strategies for this. Try to hit the boundary conditions, the most common use-cases, seek out error handling and so on.,2016-07-13
over songs. This week you'll meet one of the co-founders, Josh Whelchel. He's here to tell us all the cool ways Python makes this possible, including a touch of machine learning!,2016-08-05
https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/57/python-performance-from-the-inside-out-at-intel,Python performance from the inside-out at Intel,57,When you think about the performance of your software, there is nothing more low level and fundamental than how your code executes on the CPU itself. Many of us study and try to understand how to maximize performance at this low level. But few are in a position to define what happens at this level.,2016-05-05
