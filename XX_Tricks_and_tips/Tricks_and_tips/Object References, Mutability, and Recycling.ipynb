    "In 1997, I took a summer course on Java at MIT. The professor, Lynn Stein,1 made the point that the usual “variables as boxes” metaphor actually hinders the understanding of reference variables in object-oriented languages. Python variables are like reference variables in Java; a **better metaphor is to think of variables as labels with names attached to objects**. The next example and figure will help you understand why.\n",
