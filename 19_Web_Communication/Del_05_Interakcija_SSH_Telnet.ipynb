    "Cloud providers have made a killing from neatly-packaged managed services for years. Whether it be databases or message brokers, developers like ourselves don't seem to have a problem paying a bit extra to have things taken care of. But wait, aren't we typically the last people to opt for less optimization and less control? Why is this the time we decide otherwise? If I had to make a guess, I'd wager it's because server-side DevOps kind of sucks.\n",
