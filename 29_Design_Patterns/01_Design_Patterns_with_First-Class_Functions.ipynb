Our patterns assume Smalltalk/C++-level language features, and that choice determines what can and cannot be implemented easily. If we assumed procedural languages, we might have included design patterns called “Inheritance,” “Encapsulation,” and “Polymorphism.” Similarly, some of our patterns are supported directly by the less common object-oriented languages. CLOS has multi-methods, for example, which lessen the need for a pattern such as Visitor."

He’s talking about the Lisp and Dylan languages, but many of the relevant dynamic features are also present in Python. In particular, in the context of languages with first-class functions, Norvig suggests rethinking the classic patterns known as Strategy, Command, Template Method, and Visitor."

    "Note the callouts in Example 10-4—there is no need to instantiate a new promotion object with each new order: the functions are ready to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to note that in Design Patterns, the authors suggest: “Strategy objects often make good flyweights.” A definition of the Flyweight pattern in another part of that work states: “A flyweight is a shared object that can be used in multiple contexts simultaneously.” The sharing is recommended to reduce the cost of creating a new concrete strategy object when the same strategy is applied over and over again with every new context—with every new Order instance, in our example. So, to overcome a drawback of the Strategy pattern—its runtime cost—the authors recommend applying yet another pattern. Meanwhile, the line count and maintenance cost of your code are piling up.\n",
    "\n",
    "A thornier use case, with complex concrete strategies holding internal state, may require all the pieces of the Strategy and Flyweight design patterns combined. But often concrete strategies have no internal state; they only deal with data from the context. If that is the case, then by all means use plain old functions instead of coding single-method classes implementing a single-method interface declared in yet another class. **A function is more lightweight than an instance of a user-defined class**, and there is no need for Flyweight because **each strategy function is created just once per Python process when it loads the module**. A plain function is also “a shared object that can be used in multiple contexts simultaneously.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have implemented the Strategy pattern with functions, other possibilities emerge. Suppose you want to create a “metastrategy” that selects the best available discount for a given Order. In the following sections we study additional refactorings that implement this requirement using a variety of approaches that leverage functions and modules as objects."
