    "Any programming language is good for patterns. In fact, patterns should be considered in the context of any given programming language. Both the patterns, language syntax and nature impose limitations on our programming. The limitations that come from the language syntax and language nature (dynamic, functional, object oriented, and the like) can differ, as can the reasons behind their existence. The limitations coming from patterns are there for a reason, they are purposeful. That’s the basic goal of patterns; to tell us how to do something and how not to do it. We’ll speak about patterns, and especially Python design patterns, later."

Python is a dynamic language (did I already said that?) and as such, already implements, or makes it easy to implement, a number of popular design patterns with a few lines of code. Some design patterns are built into Python, so we use them even without knowing. Other patterns are not needed due of the nature of the language."
