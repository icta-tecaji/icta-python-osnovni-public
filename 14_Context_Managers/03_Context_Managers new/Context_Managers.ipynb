    "> Perhaps the most common (and important) use of context managers is to properly manage resources. In fact, that's the reason we use a context manager when reading from a file. The act of opening a file consumes a resource (called a file descriptor), and this resource is limited by your OS. That is to say, there are a maximum number of files a process can have open at one time. Joking aside, what is a \"file descriptor\" and what does it mean to \"leak\" one? Well, when you open a file, the operating system assigns an integer to the open file, allowing it to essentially give you a handle to the open file rather than direct access to the underlying file itself. This is beneficial for a variety of reasons, including being able to pass references to files between processes and to maintain a certain level of security enforced by the kernel."

    "- `ExitStack`:  A context manager that lets you enter a variable number of context managers. When the with block ends, ExitStack calls the stacked context managers’ `__exit__` methods in LIFO order (last entered, first exited). Use this class when you don’t know beforehand how many context managers you need to enter in your with block; for example, when opening all files from an arbitrary list of files at the same time."
