    "The original pyPdf package was released way back in 2005. The last official release of pyPdf was in 2010. After a lapse of around a year, a company called Phasit sponsored a fork of pyPdf called PyPDF2. The code was written to be backwards compatible with the original and worked quite well for several years, with its last release being in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a brief series of releases of a package called PyPDF3, and then the project was renamed to PyPDF4. All of these projects do pretty much the same thing, but the biggest difference between pyPdf and PyPDF2+ is that the latter versions added Python 3 support. There is a different Python 3 fork of the original pyPdf for Python 3, but that one has not been maintained for many years.\n",
    "\n",
    "While PyPDF2 was recently abandoned, the new PyPDF4 does not have full backwards compatibility with PyPDF2. Most of the examples in this article will work perfectly fine with PyPDF4, but there are some that cannot, which is why PyPDF4 is not featured more heavily in this article. Feel free to swap out the imports for PyPDF2 with PyPDF4 and see how it works for you."
