This is because the meaning of a sequence of 1s and 0s is dependent on the type of data it represents. For example, 10110001 must be processed differently if it represents a letter or an image.\n",

    "A common real-world scenario where Base64 encoding is heavily used are in mail servers. They were originally built to handle text data, but we also expect them to send images and other media with a message. In those cases, your media data would be Base64 encoded when it is being sent. It will then be Base64 decoded when it is received so an application can use it. "
