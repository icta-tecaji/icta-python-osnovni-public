    "<li>\n",
    "<p><code>bin/</code>: This directory holds any executable files. I’ve adapted this from <a href=\"http://as.ynchrono.us/2007/12/filesystem-structure-of-python-project_21.html\">Jean-Paul Calderone’s classic structure post</a>, and his prescriptions for the use of a <code>bin/</code> directory are still important. The most important point to remember is that your executable shouldn’t have a lot of code, just an import and a call to a <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-main-function/\">main function</a> in your runner script. If you are using pure Python or don’t have any executable files, you can leave out this directory. </p>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p><code>/docs</code>: With a more advanced application, you’ll want to maintain good documentation of all its parts. I like to put any documentation for internal modules here, which is why you see separate documents for the <code>hello</code> and <code>world</code> packages. If you use <a href=\"https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/#documenting-your-python-code-base-using-docstrings\">docstrings</a> in your internal modules (and you should!), your whole-module documentation should at the very least give a holistic view of the purpose and function of the module.</p>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p><code>helloworld/</code>: This is similar to <code>helloworld/</code> in the previous structure, but now there are subdirectories. As you add more complexity, you’ll want to use a “divide and conquer” tactic and split out parts of your application logic into more manageable chunks. Remember that the directory name refers to the overall package name, and so the subdirectory names (<code>hello/</code> and <code>world/</code>) should reflect their package names.</p>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p><code>data/</code>: Having this directory is helpful for testing. It’s a central location for any files that your application will ingest or produce. Depending on how you deploy your application, you can keep “production-level” inputs and outputs pointed to this directory, or only use it for internal testing. </p>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "<p><code>tests/</code>: Here, you can put all your tests—unit tests, execution tests, integration tests, and so on. Feel free to structure this directory in the most convenient way for your testing strategies, import strategies, and more.
