If you need to repeat a piece of code several times to get a final result, then you might need to use a **loop**. Loops are a common way of iterating multiple times and performing some actions in each iteration. Python provides two types of loops:
1. **for** loops for `definite iteration`, or performing a set number or repetitions
2. **while** loops for `indefinite iteration`, or repeating until a given condition is met
