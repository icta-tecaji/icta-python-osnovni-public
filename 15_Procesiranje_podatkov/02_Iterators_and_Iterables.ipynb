    "An integer is just a singular number, not a sequence. You may argue that the “first” number in number is 1, but it is not the same as the first item in a sequence. It doesn’t make sense to ask “What’s after 1?” from number since Python only understands integers as a single entities. Therefore, one of the requirements to be an iterable is to be able to describe to the for loop what the next item to perform the operation on is. For example, lists tell the for loop that the next item to iterate on is in the index+1 from the current one (1 comes after 0). Consequently, an iterable must also signal to a for loop when to stop iterating. This signal usually comes when we arrive at the end of a sequence (i.e. the end of a list or string). We will explore the specific functions that make something iterable later in this article, the important thing to know is that iterables describe how a for loop should traverse its contents. Generators are iterables themselves. As you’ll see later, for loops are one of the main ways we use a generator, so they must be able to support iteration. We’ll delve into how we can create our own generators in the next secton."
